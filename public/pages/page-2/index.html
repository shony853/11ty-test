<p>This website, titled &quot;Fragrant Data&quot; is a collection of 25 fragrances that 4 of my friends and I own. I tend to remember the times I spent with people by their scent, so this collection has a special meaning to me in the way that it is an archive of memories I have made with some of my favorite people. I used different fonts for each person, and I tried to find the ones that best express the image I have of the person. I wanted to metaphorically show the rows of names of fragrances in 5 different fonts as the capsules of thoughts that are stored in my mind.</p>
