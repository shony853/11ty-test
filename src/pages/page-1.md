This website is based on a story called "On Beginnings" from Madness, Rack and Honey by Mary Ruefle. The story discusses the idea that all things could be both a beginning and an ending, or there maybe aren't such things as a beginning or an ending. To convey this idea, I thought of the concept of "a spot in time" and visualized it with the shape of circles which became the main theme for the design of this project. I used fonts that use round tittles and used a dot on each page as the navigation to the next page.
