This website uses a dataset from an API token about the air quality of New York City. I filtered the data to only show the data collected in the summer of 2020, specifically the ones with Ozone(O3) ppb measurements. I used a variable font that changes weight according to the data value of the air quality measurement, to illustrate the visibility in air depending on the air quality. You can see the data collected in different geographic ranges, from community districts, boroughs, to citywide.
